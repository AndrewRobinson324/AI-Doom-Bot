# AI-Doom-Bot

This is an AI using tensorflow and Open AI Gym and vizDoom

I used the reinforcement learning model PPO which is one of the best used right now to train it. It currently only beats
the first level which is essentially a target practice with a very high efficiency and could be better if I let it train 
longer. I am eventually going to make it so that you can beat the whole using the AI. I was unable to upload the game files of the training because they are too large although I compared the first training to the last, the first yielding a mean reward of -87.38 and the last recieved a reward of +87.61 out of a possible 100 despite only being half done training from what I initially set, however it was showing signs of diminishing return
